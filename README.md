## About Me
 I am a currently Web Development Immersive Student at General Assembly, graduating early 2018.  Upon completion, I am interested in joining a fast-fashion retailer as a full-stack developer.  I am gaining experience as intern for an online clothing retailer called insattva.com, where I create marketing content, social media and blog posts.  Aside from web development, my passions in life include all things yoga, fashion, and beauty. Lets connect! &hearts;
